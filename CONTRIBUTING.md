### How to contribute?
There are repositories on GitHub that will detail how to start contributing any project. For example, this one: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source.

Even if you don't know programming, you can always help writing documentation, legal documents (terms of service, privacy policy), and other texts.

To start counter-building our project, you need to copy the HTTP web address leading to our git repository and clone the project to your computer. First, start the project (server) locally on your computer and try to go to localhost:80 in your browser. You will see the site of our project. Try all possible functions that should be in this project and find their algorithms in the code. In a word, study the project. After that you can already make any changes in it. Also have a look at the preliminary design https://www.figma.com/file/sxK69I10e0Tnh0DnIKTsXM/Netufos?type=design&node-id=5%3A2&mode=design&t=tNkkMdT9ECvex9g1-1/.  Next, commit changes, branch our repository, push changes and create a pull request. After that, we will check your request, possibly talk it over with you and confirm it.
And that's it. You've made your contribution.
